# MicroPython Library for the CircuitSetup 6 Channel Energy Meter based on the atm90e32 chipset
This library is meant to provide easy access to the data available from the CircuitSetup 6 Channel Energy Meter, which utilizes the atm90e32 chipset. We've logically separated out the SPI, atm90e32, and overall Energy Meter board layers to improve portability.

# Prior Reference
This is a fork of https://github.com/BitKnitting/CircuitSetup_micropython that laid a good bit of groundwork, but seems to have been idle for a few years. Thanks to them for the initial work on this.
